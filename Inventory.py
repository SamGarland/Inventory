#======= Shoe Inventory Manager =======#

# This programme runs a shoe inventory for a Nike store manager.
# It has the following parts: (1) "Shoe" class, that defines shoe objects and has various functions 
# for returning class attributes, (2) a list of shoe objects imported from inventory.txt, (3) a series
# of functions for manipulating and altering the information in inventory.txt, and (4) a user menu.
